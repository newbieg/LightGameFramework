1) SDL_UpdateWindowRects()
	we need a vector of rects, not pointers, these need to be full copies.
	The rects need to be updated at the start of the game loop, and
	just before drawing the screen. 
	After drawing, the vector needs to be cleared again.

	We need to decide if drawing just these rectangles would be better than
	updating the entire screen... We could possibly determine this before 
	deciding on loading the vector in the first place... would make more 
	sense in a pkmon type BS than in a side-scroller for instance.
