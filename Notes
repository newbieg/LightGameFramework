1. "undefined reference to `vtable for YourClass"
 - This is a common error I came accross while planning out a header for a class. The problem is that I've created a declaration of a virtual function (like void draw(SDL_Surface dest);) without providing a definition of that virtual function. The gcc-c++ compiler I'm working with will not give you the name of the function in question unless the class has a destructor defined for it. Either take note of which virtual functions are in your header and ensure they are defined, or create a destructor for your class and the compiler will then tell you which function is causing the problem.


IDEA;
1) SDL_UpdateWindowRects()
	we need a vector of rects, not pointers, these need to be full copies.
	The rects need to be updated at the start of the game loop, and
	just before drawing the screen. 
	After drawing, the vector needs to be cleared again.

	We need to decide if drawing just these rectangles would be better than
	updating the entire screen... We could possibly determine this before 
	deciding on loading the vector in the first place... would make more 
	sense in a pkmon type BS than in a side-scroller for instance.
