# LightGameFramework
An RPG framework ontop SDL2, generally a hobby project, Creative Commons license.

# TO DO:
text input - with option for int or float only inputs
txt - was originally made as a build-render-draw all in one. Then I tried to optimize out for more permanent text to remove the render from a draw cycle (give user option of when to render text). big mistake, better to make a new item called txtFull or something. Naming is not my strong suit...


## Here's some things I've created with the framework so far
