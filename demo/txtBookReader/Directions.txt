Welcome! 
I hope you enjoy this text reader, it's main goal is simplicity
and reduction of distractions. There are very few controls and they 
soon become natural to use.

Try out a few, like hitting the f key for Fullscreen Mode.
Drag and Drop a txt file: saves the current reading position
and opens the new file for reading

f = Fullscreen
Left Arrow = back 1 line
Right Arrow = forward 1 line
alt Left = Skip back 100 lines (about 3 pages)
alt Right = Skip forward 100 lines 
alt up/down = increase/decrease font size for easier reading
ctrl up/down = rotate through font-styles

And finally, when you're done either exit
the usual way, or use the combo keys;
alt w = Quit (close window)
