## Warning:
The majority of the files in this folder are not my own creation and therefore are not covered by my unlicensing license. Most are free to use with attribution, and the font files are generally from google fonts.

I'm currently keeping these files in "../res/" as a way to keep them for personal testing purposes. Please do not use these files without doing a reverse search and giving proper attributions.
